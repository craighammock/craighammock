# Hi, my name is Craig!

### I'm an aspiring Data Analyst and Scientist, and have recently defended my PhD in Physical Geography!

I have a passion for seeing the world through data. My PhD took me to the High Arctic, where I collected, analysed and [published](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EA002093) geophysical data on landforms in ground below freezing temperatures all year round. I am now back home in my native UK, open to opportunities in data analysis and data science!

Feel free to get in touch with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-hammock/)!
